# Solar Theme for Hugo

A minimalistic theme for [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) blogs, fork of [Solar Theme for Ghost](https://github.com/mattvh/solar-theme-ghost).

It offers two color schemes: `light` and `dark`. Additional HTML can be injected just before `</head>` and `</body>` by creating a `header.html` or `footer.html` inside `layouts/partials/`.
